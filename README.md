# CSGPurge

A small tool to cleanup CSG generated by OpenSCAD and BOSL2, to fix errors when importing into FreeCAD



## TODO

- [x] Make BOSL2 logo works with `hull()` magic (`rounding` `chamfer` etc) and `polyhedron()` removed

- [ ] Fix `hull()` generated by `cuboid(..., rounding=...)`

  Pattern match and replace with `intersection(cuboid+cyl)` for edge -> `union with sphere` for corner
  
  or just remove rounding and let user manually do it in freecad?
  
  
## Wont support
- massive `polyhedron` generated by `nut()` and `screw()` and `*_gear()`... etc
