# CSGPurge

A small tool to cleanup CSG generated by OpenSCAD and BOSL2, to fix errors when importing into FreeCAD



## TODO

- [ ] Make BOSL2 logo works with `hull()` `render()` and `polyhedron()` removed
- [ ] Fix `hull()` generated by `cuboid(..., rounding=...)`
- [ ] Fix massive polyhedron generated by `nut()`
